    <p>We should retire names the same way that sports teams retire jersey numbers. In <i>Gentrification of the Mind</i>, Sarah Schulman said that every few years she sees the faces of her dead friends, transposed onto the bodies of a younger generation. Trans people have the opportunity to be reborn, and picking a new name is often part of that. From now on, though, you can't pick Bryn.</p>

    <p>Trans women worship the dead. Every time a black trans woman is killed, every time a white woman takes her dinner in vodka and pills before standing on a stool in her room, we absorb not just the pain of her death, but a sense of righteous purpose. We are fooled into thinking that because, through the numbness of this world we actually managed to feel, that their death must have changed something.</p>

    <p>This is the lie of the martyr.<br>
    Change is the burden of the living.</p>

    <p>We have become a people of the dead. We are an unending funeral march, trudging forward, each of us shouldering the weight of the dead, praising them, wishing secretly to join them, so that we might be praised in turn. We are jealous of the uncomplicated words reserved only for the uncomplicated dead, even as we spit the names of the complicated living. And so, the corpse-weight wears each of us down, and claims the frail and the weary faster. Their bodies too are heaped onto our backs. The last one standing will be forced to carry the entire memories of us all.</p>

    <p>I hope she shrugs.</p>

    <p>Your death will not solve anything. I know many women who were <i>jealous</i> of Bryn's funeral. For a time, I counted myself among them. Who wouldn't be jealous of all those adoring people, crammed into Saint John the Divine, praising her, her art, and the ways she touched us. With our words we tried to make an angel out of a corpse, but instead birthed a chimera, a lie dissociated from any reality of the woman who was. Thank Christ for Sarah's speech. I know a girl who later wrote that she hopes that people will say nice things at her own funeral. She's hoping to be cool enough to hang out with the popular corpses. I refuse to love death. The only thing it solves is getting older. Death is the best anti-wrinkle cream.</p>

    <p>So we retire names. Nobody gets to be Bryn. You can write all the stories and poems you want, but you'll never bring her back. You can go blonde, learn how to do hair (all you have to do is give everyone a blow-out, just like she did), and suckle young trans guys at your teat, but you'll never be Bryn. You'll never bring her back. Instead of turning her into a blonde angel to be jammed atop a christmas tree, use the pain of her loss to shape the world into a place that she could have survived. Grow old; that's the one thing she never did before you.</p>
